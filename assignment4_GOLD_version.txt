Step 1.
	Select a model from the group project of your team
	e.g. Musician

Step 2.
	Identify those attributes that can be used from a sorting alorithm 
	so that we show how musician are are ordered based on 
	a specific attribute of theirs, 
	e.g. 
		- years of experience (3 [every sorting alg] X sorting order [ASC,DESC])
		- position
		- number of concerts that has participated
Step 3.
	If there are more than one attributes we need to classify each attribute 
	based on common experience
Step 4.
	Implement the following sorting alogirthms based on the previous selection of
	attributes,
	a. Quick Sort
	b. Bubble Sort
	c. Bucket Sort
Step 5. 
	Implement an hierarchical sorting (using previous 3 algorithms) 
	where you sort by the first attribute and then by the second next etc.

General Guidelines
------------------
You need to find the previous sorting algorithms and understand the way they sort items.
You need to change these algorithms so they fit your special case scenario.
You need to do a comparative analysis where you calculate 
	the time that was needed per algorithm to complete the sorting of:
- 10000 items
- ASC, DESC
- with combined attributes
